							<p><strong>Check your activation letter</strong> for the date your Sky Broadband service is due to be activated. If the date hasn't arrived yet, or you have yet to receive your letter, leave the Sky wireless router plugged in and the lights should come on as soon as you are activated.</p>

If the line is not working, you will normally be unable to connect to your broadband service, and a poor connection will lead to an intermittent service at best. If you do not get a dial tone or the line is crackling you need to contact your line provider. If you have a BT line then, contact BT's faults department on 151 (from a BT line), or 0800 800 151 (from any line). If you have a Sky Talk phone line then contact 08442 410 515</p>

							<p><strong>Broadband Optimisation period</strong></p>
							<p>When your broadband is first activated, we ask that you leave your Sky Wireless router turned on for the first ten days. This enables us to test different speeds and settings to ensure maximum stability and reliability for your broadband. During these first 10 days you may notice some variations in your broadband speed, this is normal during the optimisation process.</p>

								<li><strong>Ensure your anti-virus software is up-to-date,</strong> and run a virus check on your computer. Virus and spyware software will typically slow down your connection speeds.</li>

							<p><strong>Are you on Sky Broadband Connect?</strong></p>
							<p>After your broadband service becomes active, it will take 10 days from when you first connect and log in to establish the maximum possible speed on your line. This may vary from the estimated speed quoted when you ordered. During these first 10 days you may notice some variations in speed and your connection may be intermittent at times. Please do not contact Technical Support during this period if your speed or connection quality is changing, as this is part of the process used to stabilise your broadband service from day 11 onwards.</p>

						<div class="text">
							<p>Sky will automatically provide the fastest speed that your phone line can physically support as a reliable connection, up to the maximum download speed of your Sky Broadband product.</p>
							<p>The actual broadband speed achievable over your phone line depends on its length, the length and quality of any phone wiring in your home, the speed of connection between your computer and router, the speed of your computer, and whether all your microfilters are correctly installed.</p>
							<p>The distance you live from your local exchange will also affect your maximum connection speed, with speeds dropping the further away you get.</p>
							<p>Your broadband speed will also vary during the day depending on whether the network is busy, the websites you are visiting, whether you're sharing your connection with others in your home, and whether you have any spyware or hardware slowing down your computer. Your speed may reduce significantly during the peak period from 6pm to 9pm.</p>
