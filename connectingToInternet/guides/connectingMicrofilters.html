			<div id="guide">
				<div class="intro">
					<p>Microfilters are important because they allow your broadband, phones and Sky set-top boxes to work together on the same phone line without interfering with one another.</p>
					<p>Connecting your Sky wireless router directly to the master socket will provide you with the best broadband experience your phone line is capable of. It will often make a huge difference to both the speed and the stability of your Sky Broadband service.</p>
					<p>To see typical examples of where filters may need to be connected, select the type of socket into which you're plugging your Sky wireless router from the three common types pictured below.</p>

						<p><strong>BT master socket (NTE5)</strong><br /><br />
						This is the most common type of master socket. It is normally the first point within the home that connects to the phone line coming in from outside, and is therefore the best socket into which to plug your Sky wireless router.</p>

					<div class="connectingMicroInfoTxt">
						<p><strong>Extension socket or extension lead</strong><br /><br />
						Extension sockets are usually found in rooms that require additional phone sockets, such as kitchens and bedrooms. Extension leads are normally used if the telephone device is out of reach of the master socket but within a reasonable distance.</p>

					<div class="connectingMicroInfoTxt">
						<p><strong>Pre-filtered faceplate (NTE2000)</strong><br /><br />
						Pre-filtered faceplates are usually connected to the master socket. They are a replacement for the original faceplate and are screwed into the existing back plate - this may have been done as part of a previous broadband installation on the phone line. They are therefore a good place into which to connect your Sky wireless router.</p>
