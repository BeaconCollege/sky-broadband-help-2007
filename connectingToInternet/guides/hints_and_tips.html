				<p><img src="../../library/images/presentation/numbers/1.gif" width="34" height="27" alt="1." /><strong>Connect the router to your master socket</strong><br />
				If you are using a telephone extension socket or extension leads, try connecting your Sky wireless router into your master socket for a short time. This can help identify if there is a problem with the internal wiring between any extension sockets or leads and the master socket. Poor extension socket wiring can cause problems with your broadband connection, such as slow speeds or an intermittent connection, and can even prevent the service from working. It can also cause noise on your phone line.</p>

				<p><img src="../../library/images/presentation/numbers/2.gif" width="34" height="27" alt="2." /><strong>Use a long ethernet cable to connect the router to your PC</strong><br />
				This is preferable to connecting the router to an extension socket or an extension lead, as ethernet cables are much less susceptible to interference than telephone extension cables. They can be any length from 1 to 100 metres long. If using a longer ethernet cable is not an option for you, consider using the wireless capabilities of the router.</p>

				</ul>
				<p><img src="../../library/images/presentation/numbers/3.gif" width="34" height="27" alt="3." /><strong>If you have to use extension leads or extension sockets, follow these steps</strong></p>
				<ul class="disc">
					<li>Keep any extension leads as short as possible.</li>
					<li>Replace damaged extension leads or cabling between your master socket and extension sockets.</li>
					<li>Ensure extension leads aren't running too close to power cables, or equipment that may have flasher units such as Christmas tree lights. Also try to avoid running the extension cables too close to any high-wattage equipment such as emergen heaters, microwave ovens, cookers, air conditioning units, halogen lighting, etc.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><img src="../../library/images/presentation/numbers/4.gif" width="34" height="27" alt="4." /><strong>Check filters are installed correctly for multiple telephone extensions</strong><br />
				If possible, see if you can run multiple telephone extensions through a single filter connected into your master socket rather than connecting a two-way telephone splitter into the master socket and then connecting a filter into that.</p>
