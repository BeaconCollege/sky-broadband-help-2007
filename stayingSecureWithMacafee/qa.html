					</div>
					<div class="answer">
						<div class="text">
					        <ul class="hidden">
								<li>1.	Create user accounts. To set up parental controls, you need to create user accounts for each child who uses the computer. MacAfee recommends creating a user account for each person through the Windows Control Panel, and assigning a password.</li>
								<li>2.	Set user information. After the user accounts have been created, you must set some basic information about each user:
									<ul class="disc">
										<li>Open the Security Center (if not open).</li>
										<li>Click Configure at the bottom of the screen (near View Details), and select Users.</li>
										<li>Click Advanced.</li>
										<li>Click Parental Controls at the top left corner of the box.</li>
										<li>Select a user in the Select User drop-down box.</li>
										<li>For each user, define: 
											<ul>
												<li>The age group of that user<br />
												Note: You have the option to restrict the user to websites in the Allowed Web Sites list. Selecting this checkbox will prevent this user from getting to ANY website you do not have listed in the Allowed Web Sites list</li>
												<li>How that user is allowed to handle cookies from various websites</li>
												<li>The hours and days that you want that user to be able to access the internet.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>Click OK when finished.</li>
										<li>Now that user accounts for each child are created and configured, you can set up parental controls.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>3.	Set up parental controls:
									<ul class="disc">
										<li>Open Security Center. You should be on the Home, Protection Status page.</li>
										<li>Click on Parental Controls.</li>
										<li>Ensure Parental Controls are enabled.</li>
										<li>Click the Configure icon below Content Blocking on the right.</li>
										<li>Click Advanced.</li>
										<li>Select one of the following and add or modify:
											<ul>
												<li>Blocked Web Sites</li>
												<li>Allowed Web Sites</li>
												<li>Cookies</li>
												<li>Keywords</li>
												<li>Image Analysis</li>
												<li>Keyword Scanning.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>Repeat the steps above for each user.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Once you've finished, you can check the parental control settings for each user as follows:</p>
							<ul class="disc">
								<li>Open the Security Center.</li>
								<li>Click Configure at the bottom of the screen (near View Details), and select Users.</li>
								<li>Under the Users section, click Advanced.</li>

					        <p>Yes - as an Administrator, you can set a user's content rating group and then block or allow websites based on those groups. If you want to rate content for a user more strictly, you can also prevent the user from browsing any websites that are not included in the global Allow Web Sites list.</p>
							<p>A user can belong to one of the following content rating groups:</p>

						<h2><a class="open" href="#5">Open</a><a class="text" href="#5">How do I block access to websites?</a></h2>
					</div>
					<div class="answer">
						<div class="text">
					        <p>To access the list of blocked and allowed websites, follow these steps:</p>
							<ul class="hidden">
								<li>1.	Open Security Center. You should be on the Home, Protection Status page.</li>
								<li>2.	Click on Parental Controls.</li>
								<li>3.	Ensure parental controls are enabled.</li>
								<li>4.	Click the Configure icon below Content Blocking on the right.</li>
								<li>5.	Click Advanced.</li>
								<li>6.	Select one of the options below and click Add or Modify:
									<ul class="disc">
										<li>Blocking websites. If you are an Administrator and you want to prevent all non-adult users from accessing a particular website, you may block the website. When a user tries to access a blocked website, a message appears indicating that the site cannot be accessed because it is blocked by McAfee. Users (including Administrators) that belong to the 'adult' content rating group can access all websites, even if the websites are in the Blocked Web Sites list. To test blocked websites, you must log in as a non-adult user.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>As an Administrator, you can also block websites based on the keywords that the websites contain. McAfee maintains a default list of keywords and corresponding rules, which determines whether a user of a certain age group is permitted to browse a website where a keyword exists. When keyword scanning is enabled, the default list of keywords is used to rate content for users. However, you can add your own allowable keywords to the default list and associate these with certain age groups. Keyword rules that you add will override a rule that might be associated with a matching keyword in the default list. You can either look up existing keywords or specify new keywords to associate with certain age groups.</p>
							<ul class="disc">
								<li>Allowing websites. If you are an Administrator, you can allow all users to access a particular website, overriding any default settings and blocked websites.</li>
								<li>Allowing websites to set cookies. If you block all websites from reading the cookies they set on your computer, or configure certain users to receive a message prompt before cookies are accepted, and then find that certain websites do not function properly, you can allow those sites to read their cookies.</li>
								<li>Blocking potentially inappropriate web images. You can protect members of your family by blocking potentially inappropriate images from appearing when browsing the internet. Images are blocked for all users except members of the adult age group.</li>

					</div>
					<div class="answer">
						<div class="text">
					        <p>Some websites create small files on your computer called cookies to monitor your personal preferences and browsing habits. As an Administrator, you can assign one of the following cookie blocking levels to a user:</p>
							<ul class="disc">
								<li>Accept all cookies - allows websites to read the cookies that they set on your computer when the corresponding user is logged in.</li>
								<li>Reject all cookies - prevents websites from reading the cookies.</li>
								<li>Prompt user to accept all cookies - prompts the user each time a website attempts to set a cookie on your computer. The user can then decide whether to allow cookies on a case-by-case basis. After the user decides to accept or reject cookies for a particular website, they are not prompted again for that website.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>If you choose to set your McAfee Security to reject all cookies, this may prevent you from being able to access or sign into some websites - for example when you are signing into a website to check email, or make a purchase.</p>

						<div class="text">
					        <p>If your McAfee Security is set to block cookies, this may prevent you from being able to sign into some websites - for example when you are signing into a website to check email, or make a purchase. To check your cookie settings:</p>
							<ul class="disc">
								<li>Double-click on the McAfee Security Center icon on your computer desktop.</li>
								<li>Select Configure in the Security Center Information screen.</li>
								<li>In the Configuration screen, select Users in the main screen, and then click on the Advanced button.</li>
								<li>In the Parental Controls screen, use the drop-down menu to select each user you have set up - 'Administrator' is the only user set up by default, but if you are using parental controls you will also have additional users set up for other people using the computer. Select Cookie Blocking to see whether cookies are accepted, or being rejected/blocked.</li>

					</div>
					<div class="answer">
						<div class="text">
					        <p>Yes - as an Administrator, you can use the internet time limits grid to specify if and when a user can access the internet. You can grant a user unrestricted internet use, limited internet use, or prohibit internet use entirely.</p>
							<p>The internet time limits grid allows you to specify time limits in 30-minute intervals. Green portions of the grid represent the days and times during which the user can access the internet. Red portions of the grid represent the days and times during which access is denied. If a user tries to access the internet during a prohibited period, McAfee notifies the user that they cannot do so. If you prohibit a user from accessing the internet entirely, that user can log in and use the computer, but not the internet.</p>
